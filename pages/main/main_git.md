The most important things to know are in the first set of tutorials in the Main and Remote parts. The rest will be used less often, but you can learn them for your personal advancement.

We use Git, and GitHub because they provide free organization accounts for FIRST teams. If you're a student, you can also apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get free private repositories and other goodies.
